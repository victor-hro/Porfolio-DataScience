# Portfolio Data Science
by: Victor Hugo Rocha de Oliveira

This repository serves as a collection of my Data Science projects showcasing various applications, analyses, and machine learning models.

## Projects

### MLOps and Web App Projects
* [Spotify Web App](https://github.com/victor-hro/spotify-web-api): Web app using Spotify API and Streamlit.
* [MLOps-HousePrices](https://github.com/victor-hro/mlops-house-prices): Web App for House Price Prediction encapsulated in a Docker container. The project provides an interactive web application to forecast house prices based on Machine Learning models. The entire codebase is encapsulated within a Docker container for easy execution and deployment.
*  [Flask-Template](https://github.com/victor-hro/mlops-deploy-flask): Basic template for deploying Flask applications.
*  [Stock Prices: AWS Sagemaker | Lambda | API Gateway](https://github.com/victor-hro/stockprices-sagemaker-lambda): The project showcases an approach to stock price prediction using AWS SageMaker, Lambda, and API Gateway, demonstrating proficiency in modern data science and software engineering tools.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
* [Predict Medical Insurance Cost](https://github.com/victor-hro/medical-insurance-prediction): Analyzing data from a health insurer to predict future insurance and identify factors leading to higher health care costs.
* [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/victor-hro/movie-recommender): Movie recommender system based on collaborative filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors.
* [Predict Cardiovascular Disease](https://github.com/victor-hro/cardiovascular-disease-prediction): Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cardiovascular disease prediction model.
* [Drug Discovery](https://github.com/victor-hro/drug-discovery): Machine learning approaches to develop predictive models that can determine whether a particular compound is active or not. The goal would be to develop the best binary classification model.

### Image and Text Generation
* [LLM Text and Image Generator](https://github.com/victor-hro/llm-text-image-generator): This project involves generating images and text using OpenAI, Streamlit and Docker.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
* [Airbnb Growth Strategies](https://github.com/victor-hro/airbnb-growth-strategies): Exploratory Data Analysis project aiming to develop growth strategies for Airbnb hosts, providing insights into accommodation, cancellation policies, location analysis, and host performance.
